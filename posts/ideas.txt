Lust at First Sight - exposition on marriage and romantic love and 
    how the secular vision fails. 

On Righteousness - how Jesus is the only one who is truly righteous

On the Problem of Evil - make a theodicy with the centrality of Christ in focus

On Euthyphro - answer this objection with the centrality of Christ in mind. 
    First, goodness is only something God has. To say something is good is
    to compare it to an objective, transcendent standard. This means God. The 
    Bible claims that only God is truly good, thus to say that "God is good"
    is a tautology, but that's not a problem. What we mean by "good" must mean
    that it is comparing it to God.

On Freedom from Sin - What it means that a Christian is freed from sin, namely
    that the righteousness of Jesus frees me from that which causes me to sin
    from the start - fear and pride.
