[
For through the law, I died to the law, so that I might live to God. I have
been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives
in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, 
who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not nullify the grace of God, for if
righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose.
{- Galatians 2:19-21}

The organ moans out the familiar tune. All the people stand in respect. The
bride begins her slow walk down the aisle. At the front of the church, the 
groom waits expectantly for his bride.

The two stand and face the minister. The bride and groom express complete trust
in the other. Each of them vow complete faithfulness to the exclusion of 
any other. It is an act of complete trust. They make each other completely 
vulnerable to the other. And the final result is that the two become one flesh.

But this deep, mysterious union of two becoming one refers to Christ and the
church, Paul says. (verse)  Those who make themselves totally vulnerable to 
Christ by placing their full trust in him find themselves in a beautiful union
with him. This union runs so deep that God sees the Christian and their savior
as one and the same. Consequently, Jesus' life becomes my own life. This is
how Paul can declare "I am crucified with Christ." (verse) This union between
Paul and Jesus runs so deep that God sees Jesus as dying Paul's death. But
this also means that as God raised Jesus from the dead, in full acceptance and
vindication of his life, Paul now lives in such a vindicated state. This is the
state of any who believe, or "Christ and the church."

# Righteousness ##

The Bible presents God as goodness itself. 

# Accepted by God ##


What is righteousness?
 -> acceptance
 -> recieving a good report

How can Christ be our righteousness?
  -> Christ doesn't confer righteousness
    -> Imputed righteousness doesn't mean that Jesus gives us righteousness
    -> Jesus alone is the righteous one
    -> Jesus was what everyone ought to have been
  -> Christ brings us into union with himself
    -> Weird
    -> Like a marriage
    -> "Put him on", "abide in him", all point to a mysterious union with Christ
      -> This refers to Christ and the church
      -> Wedding supper of the lamb
      -> Unbreakable commitment to those who trust in him
      -> Two become one flesh

What does this mean?
  -> Christ already died a death - the full payment of the law
    -> The penalty of breaking the law was death
    -> So, sinners who have broken the law, and merited death, have in a sense
        already died
        -> I am crucified with Christ
        -> other passages
    -> But God raised Jesus from the dead, vindicating him and seating him at his
        own right hand
        -> So, since we are united to him, we are raised with him
        -> passages

Implications
  -> I am and never will be righteous
  -> But through the union I have with Jesus, I have already paid the penalty
      of sin (dying with Jesus), and live vindicated in God's presence 
      (because Jesus is vindicated)
  -> Thus my righteousness and acceptance before God cannot be any worse than 
      his approval of Jesus

Shall I sin that grace may abound?
  -> But now you're free! Because what you are always looking for is fully 
      satisfied.
